        About Us
      </h3>
      <p>
        With the gradual opening of society from full lockdowns of a Global Pandemic, everyone is eager to rush out to the opening stores. The four of us - Zac Waite, Greyson Martyn, Luke Parna-Gile and Kellan MacDonald - identified an issue. Even with a rush of keen customers, stores still have a capacity. Driving across town to get to a store to see lines wrapping around buildings is disappointing. Staying home to avoid lines is certainly not appealing when lockdowns have kept us home for months on months already. A solution to both these issues can be found at an automatic tracker of a store's capacity that will provide the valuable information to customers before they have even left their home.

        Capacity Controller allows customers to see how busy local grocery stores are. From there, they can choose to drive to a further location if closer stores are at full capacity. Or know that it is a good time to go to a nearby grocery store.At the stores that are at full capacity, the automatic counter will show a red light at the door as a stop indication. After one person walks in, a yellow light will be an indication to stay six feet away and wait for one person to enter the store at a time.
